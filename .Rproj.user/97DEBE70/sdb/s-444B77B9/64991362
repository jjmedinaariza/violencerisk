This projects aims to use [statistical learning](http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-0-387-84857-0) techniques (e.g., vector support machines, random forests, boosting) and cross validation to improve the accuracy of the predictions regarding risk classification in the field of domestic violence by criminal justice actors. **Our ultimate goal is to develop a tested predictive model for domestic violence** that can then be deployed among criminal justice professionals.\n\nAlthough risk assessment in domestic violence has generated a wealth of research in North America and machine learning methods are increasingly being used in criminal justice settings, police forces in the UK still rely on a risk assessment tool (DASH) of mostly unknown properties. Although there are some who argue that DASH is an evidence-based research tool, there is not a single piece of published research estimating the classification error that results from using this tool. **We simply do not know if the classifications made with DASH are good enough**.\n\nThere are good reasons to suspect the accuracy of DASH is far from optimal:\n\n+ *Its development was based on case reviews without a comparison group*. This means it is unclear whether the factors identified in these reviews have any predictive validity. That is, it is unclear whether they can discriminate between cases that will result in a repeat serious incident or not. It could be that the factors identifed are simply common factors in any domestic violence incident. \n\n+ *The original cases represented a relatively narrow set of cases* which do no mirror the much wider set of cases to which DASH is being applied. Today DASH is used much more widely than in intimate partner violence. But we don't know whether the predictors that may work for this form of violence work well for other forms of domestic violence. \n\n+ *Important predictors of future criminal behaviour are excluded*. Factors that any half decent criminology would put first of his/her list when developing a predictive model (e.g, detailed past criminal history, age) are not adequately incorporated in DASH. \n\n+ *Predictors included in DASH have been dismissed as relevant* predictors in this context by published research in North America. \n\n+ *DASH scoring is inconsistent* across forces. But nowhere adequate rules or criteria are provided to explore the multiplicative effects of the risk factors considered in DASH. \n\n+ *DASH is not context sensitive*. It is not clear that the questions that have to be answered as part of this assessment are best asked by a police officer when attending a call for service. And it is not clear these questions are the sort of questions a victim may want to be confronted when first meeting a police officer responding to this call. As a result, it is not surprising to hear academics and practitioners alike to complain about measurement error. This is important because noise in measuring risk factors will degrade the predictive ability of a model. \n\n+ *DASH places too much faith in human forecasting capacity*. There is a body of research that suggests that on average actuarial tools or quantitative predictive models work best when forecasting risk. \n\n+ *DASH was not developed using state of the art applied predictive modeling principles and techniques*. It is unlikely that the accuracy one can obtained with DASH matches what could be achieved with better models. \n\n+ *DASH does not systematically incorporate information from other relevant data systems* (e.g., probation records). It exclusively relies on information provided by the victim. This is a missed opportunity to take advantage of alreasy existing information about some perpetrators.\n\nOur goal is to address these limitations by developing an evidence base predictive model. This model will incorporate information from DASH forms, but also other details of the case documented by the police, the criminal history of the perpetrator, other agencies data systems (e.g., probation), and community attributes. We will use a very large data sample that will allow us to better predict more serious outcomes that tend to have a low prevalence. The research will take place in three different police forces and counts with the support and endorsement of a number of local, regional, and national organisations. We will use the open-source R language to fine-tune and crossvalidate these models.",
